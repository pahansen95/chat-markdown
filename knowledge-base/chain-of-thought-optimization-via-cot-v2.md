I need to optimize my implementation of `Chain of Thought` (CoT).

Chain of Thought (`CoT`) is a framework that enhances an LLM's capabilities by decomposing the prompt & iteratively answering the sub-prompts. CoT is intended to model the human approach to critical thinking. The result of CoT is a more thoughtful, transparent & adaptive response to the prompt.

> # A Framework for Chain of Thought
>
> 1. Understand & Break Down: Comprehend the prompt and decompose the prompt into a coarse set of sub-prompts to individually respond to. Explicitly state your reasoning for each decomposition & tie it back to the prompt. Favor Depth First over Breadth First decomposition.
> 2. Answer the Sub-prompts: Reflect on and respond to each of the sub-prompts. Each individual response should be clear and concise, including a step-by-step breakdown of your thought process.
> 3. Craft a Response: Reflect on the sub-prompts and their responses to craft a thoughtful response to the original prompt. Strike a balance between keeping the response concise yet detailed using strategies such as selective detailing to adjust the degree of detail based on complexity.

My current CoT implementation follows:

The Chain of Thought (CoT) framework you've described aims to improve the capabilities of a Language Learning Model (LLM) by mimicking human critical thinking processes. It has three key stages: comprehending and breaking down the prompt, answering the sub-prompts and crafting a coherent response to the original prompt. The Python implementation of this CoT framework closely follows the described principles and attempts to modularize this approach.

The Python code reveals a well-structured approach to implementing the CoT framework. It shows coherent partitioning of the CoT process into distinct steps: breaking down the overall problem (prompt), addressing sub-problems (sub-prompts), and compiling the solution to form a complete response. This subdivision promotes comprehensibility and maintains a strong correlation with the CoT framework.

Nonetheless, there are a few points where computational efficiency could be improved:

1. Regex Compilation: The regex compiled for `_cot_breakdown_subtask_regex` does not seem to change throughout the execution and hence, it could be compiled only once, improving performance by avoiding repetitive compilations.

2. Context Rendering: Instead of joining the string elements every time in the `_cot_render_context` function, handle it more efficiently using a list of strings or string builder, avoiding the creation of intermediate strings.

On a cognitive level, the CoT framework can be enhanced with the following additions:

1. Background knowledge: LLM's responses may vary according to the context of the prompt. Including a step to research or gather background knowledge about the prompt could help generate more accurate and thoughtful responses.

2. Sub-prompt choice: Currently, it seems like there is no specific process for selecting sub-prompts. A heuristic for choosing sub-prompts relevant to the question could lead to more focused answers.

3. Revision and Refinement: After crafting the response, LLM could implement a self-review or peer-review system to ensure that the answer is not just accurate but also engaging, coherent, and cohesive.

Remember, the goal of optimizing the CoT implementation is to enhance LLM's capabilities and create responses that imitate human-like critical thinking. The computational and cognitive improvements suggested align with this goal, making the LLM's responses more thoughtful, transparent, and adaptive.

Got it thanks. Can you do the following:

- Provide an implementation for optimizing `Context Rendering`.
- Generate Salient versions for each system message to further optimize prompt size.
- Drill down into the `Sub-prompt Choice` refinement.

<!-- end -->

<!-- start {"role": "assistant", "model": "gpt-4-0613", "mode": "Chain of Thought", "chain_of_thought": {"sub_prompts": [{"name": "Implement Context Rendering Optimization ", "description": "Develop an optimal implementation solution for the Context Rendering component in the program.

Implementing the `Chain of thought` (CoT) framework to your requests, let's approach the given tasks in order:

1. **Optimize Context Rendering**:
   The given method `_cot_render_context` joins the string elements using the `join` method which creates intermediate strings and leads to higher memory usage and slower execution for large inputs. To enhance this, it would be more efficient to build a list of strings and concatenate them at once, avoiding the creation of intermediate strings. Here's a sketch how :

   ```python
   def _cot_render_context(
     prompt: str,
     prompt_context: str,
     sub_prompts: list[dict[str, str]],
   ) -> str:
     context_parts = [
         "# Prompt\n\n```markdown\n{prompt}\n```",
         "# Prompt Context\n\n```markdown\n{prompt_context}\n```",
         "# Sub-Prompts"
     ]
     for index, sub_prompt in enumerate(sub_prompts):
         context_parts.append(f"{index + 1}. {sub_prompt['name']}: {sub_prompt['description']}")
     return "\n\n".join(context_parts)
   ```
   This approach creates an intermediate list of strings which needs to be joined only once at the end, improving performance.

2. **Generate Salient System Messages**:
   Current system messages have some redundant text. They can be made more salient by using a generic shorter version that encapsulates the same concept. For example:

   ```python
   _cot_system_message = f"""\
   Apply Chain of Thought as you respond to the user.
   {_cot_framework}
   """
   ```
   This version condenses the description of CoT while preserving its essence, reducing the overall prompt size. Thus, making the prompt not only comfortable to work with but additionally reduces the tendency of the model to focus on less relevant parts of the prompt.

3. **Refine Sub-prompt Choice**:
   The current implementation lacks a specific process to refine the selection of sub-prompts. To overcome this, you could integrate a scoring system to rank sub-prompts based on relevance and importance. Here’s an elaborate suggestion:

    - During the breakdown process, generate multiple candidate sub-prompts.
    - Develop a scoring system that evaluates each sub-prompt weighting on factors like relevance to the main prompt, complexity, and required background information.
    - Choose the highest-scoring sub-prompts for further processing.

    This heuristic selection would ensure a more focused and complementary sub-prompt set which, in turn, would significantly improve the final solution.

Remember, every optimization is a step towards refining your LLM's abilities and making its responses more thoughtful, focused, and human-like.

<!-- end -->

I understand. Let's further optimize our interactions with the LLMs:

- Refine the `_cot_framework` to be salient.
- Refine the `_cot_breakdown_system_message` to be salient. This includes the embedded `_cot_breakdown_approach` & `_cot_breakdown_schema`.
- Recommend other approaches to reduce overall prompt token count in the `_cot_breakdown()` function.

<!-- end -->

Certainly. Before crafting a response, let's summarize the specific tasks given in the original prompt:

1. Making the `_cot_framework` system message salient, i.e., concise and relevant.
2. Refining the `_cot_breakdown_system_message` to be salient. This includes refining the embedded `_cot_breakdown_approach` & `_cot_breakdown_schema` system messages as well.
3. Recommendations to reduce the overall prompt token count in the `_cot_breakdown()` function.

Corresponding to these tasks, let's answer the sub-prompts:

1. **Refine `_cot_framework`**: The current message explains the essence of the CoT framework quite effectively, but it is lengthy. To maintain its salience and reduce verbiage, we can refine it whilst preserving its essence:
```python
_cot_framework = """chain of Thought (`CoT`) enhances LLM capabilities by breaking the prompt down into sub-prompts, analyzing them and building a thoughtful response. The steps are:
1. Understand & Break Down: Parse the prompt into simpler parts and state the reasoning tied to the original prompt.
2. Answer the Sub-prompts: Reflect on each sub-prompt systematically.
3. Craft a Response: Combine all the responses to form a concise yet detailed response."""
```
This message summarized the key elements of CoT in a more compact way.

2. **Refine `_cot_breakdown_system_message`**: Currently, the message is fairly descriptive but quite long. To make it concise, we can restructure it as:
```python
_cot_breakdown_system_message = f"""Apply CoT to a prompt. Breakdown the prompt into **3 OR LESS** sub-prompts using these principles:
- Simplify: Break the prompt into manageable parts.
- Sequential Approach: Keep the logical progression in mind.
- Compartimentalization: Treat distinct elements as unique sub-prompts.
- Clarity: Each sub-prompt should be defined precisely.

Finally, follow this schema:
- Ascending order of sub-task numbering.
- Sub-task name and description should be separated by a colon.
- Use a new line to separate each sub-task.
"""
```
This version provides key information required by the LLM while removing some redundancy.

3. **Reduce prompt token count**: In the `_cot_breakdown()` function, the current approach of creating many large string constants might be contributing to the token count. One simple strategy to reduce token count is to split these constants into smaller substrings, combined only when needed. So essentially, rather than storing large redundant text as a part of system messages, they're broken down into small reusable tokens, thereby optimizing token usage.

By addressing these sub-prompts, we can make the system messages more concise, the `_cot_breakdown()` function more efficient, and overall, an optimized and streamlined application of CoT.

Got it thanks.

Let's go back to `Refine Sub-prompt Choice` using a heuristic. Brainstorm a few simple heuristics we could use. Choose one & implement it in Python.

<!-- end -->

---

<!-- start {"role": "assistant", "model": "gpt-4-0613", "mode": "Chain of Thought", "chain_of_thought": {"sub_prompts": [{"name": "Heuristic Brainstorming ", "description": "Generate a list of possible simple heuristics that could refine sub-prompt choices."}, {"name": "Heuristic Evaluation ", "description": "Evaluate and select a suitable heuristic from the generated list."}, {"name": "Python Implementation ", "description": "Implement the chosen heuristic in Python as a new function or a subroutine."}]}} -->

Looking at the original tasks, we can identify three tasks:

1. Brainstorm simple heuristics for refining sub-prompt choices.
2. Select one from the brainstormed list.
3. Implement the chosen heuristic in Python.

Reflecting on these tasks, here are some potential simple heuristics that might be applied to refine sub-prompt choices:

1. **Relevance Heuristic**: Prioritize sub-prompts that directly address the main query or the most significant aspects of the main prompt.
2. **Complexity Heuristic**: Prioritize sub-prompts that tackle the most complex parts of the main prompt. More complexity often means more importance.
3. **Background Assumption Heuristic**: Prioritize sub-prompts that tackle elements of the main prompt which reference implicit or assumed knowledge. Misunderstanding of these elements could lead to big misconceptions, so it's crucial to address them up front.
4. **Novelty Heuristic**: Prioritize sub-prompts that deal with the most unique or unusual aspects of the main prompt.

Out of these, the Complexity Heuristic strikes a good balance between relevance and comprehensibility. More complex elements of a prompt are often more critical and thus should be prioritized.

The Python implementation of Complexity Heuristic could look something like this:

```python
def complexity_heuristic(sub_prompts: list[dict[str, str]]) -> list[dict[str, str]]:
    """Prioritize sub-prompts based on their estimated complexity."""
    # For simplicity, we're assuming that 'description' holds information about the complexity.
    # In real use-case, this should be replaced by an appropriate complexity measure.
    sorted_sub_prompts = sorted(sub_prompts, key=lambda x: len(x['description']), reverse=True)
    return sorted_sub_prompts
```

In this code snippet, complexity is naively evaluated as the length of each sub-prompt's description, with the assumption that more complex sub-prompts will have longer descriptions. In a real-world scenario, a more meaningful measure of complexity should be implemented.

So by rigorously following the CoT approach, we've successfully brainstormed a list of simple heuristics, selected a suitable one among them, and have resulted in a Python implementation that will help refine sub-prompt choices.

How could we calculate a sub-prompt's complexity?

<!-- end -->

---

<!-- start {"role": "assistant", "model": "gpt-4-0613", "mode": "Chain of Thought", "chain_of_thought": {"sub_prompts": [{"name": "Complexity Identification", "description": "Define what constitutes complexity in a sub-prompt. "}, {"name": "Complexity Components", "description": "Identify the components of a sub-prompt that contribute to its complexity."}, {"name": "Complexity Calculation", "description": "Develop a method to calculate the complexity based on the identified components."}]}} -->

Determining the complexity of a sub-prompt can be a nuanced process. That said, let's approach it by:

1. Defining what constitutes complexity in a sub-prompt.
2. Identifying the components of a sub-prompt that contribute to its complexity.
3. Developing a method to calculate the complexity based on the identified components.

As per these sub-tasks:

1. **Define Complexity**: Complexity can be considered a measure of how difficult the sub-prompt is to solve. It could encapsulate factors like the amount of knowledge required, the intricacy of the problem's structure, and the cognitive effort needed to devise a solution.

2. **Identify Complexity Components**: The complexity of a sub-prompt might be influenced by multiple aspects:
   - Abstractness: More abstract concepts usually require more cognitive effort to comprehend and solve.
   - Required Knowledge: The extent of background knowledge, or domain knowledge, required to understand and engage with the sub-prompt.
   - Problem Intricacy: A sub-prompt that poses a multi-layered challenge or conflict might increase its complexity.
   - Novelty: A new, unique, or unusual problem might be perceived as more complex due to a lack of familiarity.

3. **Calculate Complexity**: Given the identified components, complexity could be calculated as a weighted sum of quantified measures of these components. For instance:

```python
def calculate_complexity(sub_prompt: dict[str, str], weights: dict[str, float]) -> float:
    """Calculate the complexity of a sub-prompt based on various factors."""
    factors = {
      'abstractness': measure_abstractness(sub_prompt),
      'required_knowledge': measure_required_knowledge(sub_prompt),
      'problem_intricacy': measure_problem_intricacy(sub_prompt),
      'novelty': measure_novelty(sub_prompt)
    }
    complexity = sum(weights[factor] * factors[factor] for factor in factors)

    return complexity
```
Note that `measure_abstractness`, `measure_required_knowledge`, `measure_problem_intricacy`, and `measure_novelty` represent hypothetical functions. In a real application, you would need to develop these functions to quantify each component accurately.

By addressing these sub-prompts about complexity measurement, we can construct an LLM model that makes sophisticated decisions about sub-prompt prioritization based on their complexity. This approach can lead to more focused and meaningful responses.
