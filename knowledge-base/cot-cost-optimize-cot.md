I need to cost optimize my implementation of `Chain of Thought` (CoT).

```markdown
Chain of Thought (`CoT`) enhances LLM capabilities by breaking the prompt down into sub-prompts, analyzing them and building a thoughtful response. The steps are:
1. Breakup the prompt into three consituent sub-prompts.
2. Answer each individual sub-prompt, in order, providing detail proportinal to it's complexity.
3. Craft a holistic response to the original prompt reflecting on the sub-prompts and their responses.
```

Here is my current implementation:

````python
from ._interfaces import ChatMessage, LLM

import logging
import re
logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

### Chain of Thought ###

Deconstruct the given prompt into 3 sub-prompts using these principles:
- Simplify: Break the prompt into manageable parts.
- Sequential Approach: Keep the logical progression in mind.
- Compartimentalization: Treat distinct elements as unique sub-prompts.
- Clarity: Each sub-prompt should be defined precisely.

Finally, follow this schema:
- Format sub-tasks as an ordered markdown list.
- Each Sub-task item has a 3 word name and salient one-line description separated by a colon.

Example:
```markdown
1. First Task Name : Short task description on a single line.

From OpenAI's Website:

> Prices are per 1,000 tokens. You can think of tokens as pieces of words, where 1,000 tokens is about 750 words. This paragraph is 35 tokens.

Generally speaking outputs are 1.25~2x the cost of inputs.

Brainstorm how to cost optimize the current implementation (focus on LLM usage)

1. **Identify Costly Components**

The `_cot_breakdown` and `chain_of_thought` functions seem to be the most computationally expensive. Both these functions call the `llm.chat` method which is likely to be the most resource-intensive operation. Within the `_cot_breakdown` method, the input message to the `llm.chat` method is a concatenation of previous messages and a new user message. The length of these messages is proportional to the computational cost.

2. **Optimize LLM Usage**

Optimize the usage of `llm.chat` by reducing the number of times it is called and the amount of data sent per call. Since the token cost for gpt-3.5-turbo is primarily dependent on the input and output tokens, reducing them would directly lower costs.

- `Chain of Thought (CoT) breakdown`: Since the breakdown subtask is using a separate instance of LLM (cot_llm), consider using a lighter LLM model or a regular expression-based breakup method for the breakdown task. This operation doesn't necessarily require a full-powered LLM.
- `Reducing input tokens`: Tokens in the input prompt can be reduced by sending shorter system and user messages or by limiting the number of past conversation turns sent. Investigate whether the context information is crucial for generating the correct output or if it can be reduced without losing accuracy.

3. **Suggest Structural Changes**

- `Caching`: Introduce caching to avoid repeated computations. If a prompt is repeated, you can store the result of the prompt and return the result from the cache instead of calling `llm.chat` again.
- `Parallel processing`: If applicable and the use case allows, some of the LLM inquiries related to the sub-prompts or different chain of thought processes can be made concurrently.
- `Asynchronous execution`: In the current implementation, each LLM chat call is awaited immediately after being called. If these calls can be made asynchronous, e.g., by using Python's `asyncio.gather()`, it could allow for other tasks to run simultaneously, thus potentially decreasing the execution time.

Can you recommend some more ways we can cost optimize my implementation?

1. **Increase Efficiency of Regex**

The `_cot_breakdown` method uses a regular expression to extract subtasks from the product of the `llm.chat` method. It's possible that the regular expression could be made more efficient. Based on the complexity of the regular expression, it might be worth considering whether an alternate method for this extraction could be less computationally expensive.

2. **Avoid Duplication**

Try to avoid duplicate or redundant computations where possible. In the current setup, if two tasks have similar prompts, the model needs to respond separately for both, which is a waste of computational resources. By ensuring that similar tasks are handled together or are run only once, you can save on the number of tokens processed.

3. **Selective context selection**

The context sent to the `_cot_breakdown` function comprises all previous messages' content. Instead, preferentially choose crucial parts of the context to avoid unnecessary communication with the model, thereby saving tokens. Make sure not to lose critical context information essential for response generation.

4. **Reducing Complexity of Tasks**

Another angle to approach this problem would be to reduce the complexity of the tasks passed to the `llm.chat`. Simpler tasks would translate to shorter and less complex subtasks, which could potentially lead to a reduction in input-output tokens and hence cost.

5. **Batch Querying**

If suitable, batch queries can be sent to `llm.chat` in a single call instead of several individual ones. This benefit gets realised when you have many independent sub-prompts. Just make sure not to exceed the maximum limit on the number of tokens a language model can handle.

Please note that all of these recommendations should be implemented with respect to the specific computational constraints and objectives of your application.
